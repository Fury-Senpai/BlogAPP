    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-5 text-center">
      I'm a <span class="font-semibold text-indigo-600">Web Developer</span> who enjoys building functional, clean, and real-world web apps using modern tools and logic.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      I work primarily with <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express.js</strong> to build backend systems that handle routing, middleware, and secure APIs. I'm comfortable managing databases using <strong>MongoDB</strong> with <strong>Mongoose</strong>, ensuring my data is well-structured and easily queried.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      My apps use <strong>JWT authentication</strong>, <strong>cookie-based sessions</strong>, and <strong>role-based access control</strong>. Whether it's protecting an admin panel, showing dynamic headers based on login, or building like-systems — I make sure the logic is scalable and clean.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      For frontend templating, I use <strong>EJS</strong> with layouts and partials. And with <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, I make sure the UI is simple, responsive, and consistent with the user’s role and state.
    </p>

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Beyond projects, I genuinely love <strong>coding</strong> — whether it's debugging backend logic or writing clean frontend views, I enjoy every step of the process.
